Men -

After we breached hyperspace, we found ourselves on intercept course with the remainder of the fleet who snuffed our tech miners and stole their cargo. Hope I don't have to make any announcements about what's at stake here.

The Onslaught-class "HSS Rajah II" is still operational, as well as parts of its escort. If we can stop them here, the payoff will be truly enormous. You have some of the best destroyer pilots known to the Sector, Commodore. This is their chance to become infamous - just keep their egoes in check until the opportunity arises. We know how Desdinova crews think and act, you and me...
