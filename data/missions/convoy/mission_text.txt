Something is not quite right at Strategic command ...

We find ourselves moving a precious cargo of plump vegetables and delicate spices to the soup factories in Breh'inni 4, with a little bit more trouble than we anticipated.

A mercenary fleet, apparently operating for the promise of Hegemony wealth, has ordered us to disarm, surrender our cargo, and follow them out of the system.

Surrender, of course, is not an option.

If we can just manouevre past the slow, but heavily armed ships of this mercenary outfit, we can give the King the soup he so richly deserves.
