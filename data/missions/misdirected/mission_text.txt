While en route to her assigned station in Devaux, the HSS Algiers has lost her bearings and has blundered perilously close to Shadowyards controlled space.  Rather than risk becoming further disoriented, however, her captain blithely maintains his position, sending out a general distress signal.  While certain to alert SHI to his ships presence he is confident that his ship can handle anything the rebel scum can throw at him.

His crew, accustomed to their commanders peculiar madness, settle into their stations and wait for rescue... or the enemy.
