"Ok ... that's what that button does ..."

You are the Captain of the RNS Abalone and you have taken an unexpected and unwanted jump in to a nearby system.

Thankfully an escort vessel (the RNS Whelk)was shadowing you, and has managed to follow along from your jump signature.

As well as providing excellent company, they should make the re-acquisition of some fuel for the jump back slightly easier.
