A small Cult of Lud raiding group has been targeting SHI shipping passing through an isolated star system, executing effective hit and fade attacks against several convoys.

You have been sent in to contain the threat; despite considerable efforts on the part of the Luddite commander to elude you, you have finally cornered his force near an arid world.

Show him what for.
