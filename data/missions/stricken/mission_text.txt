Location: An unremarkable star near Corvus
Date: 213.07.62

While on patrol near the Hegemony Core worlds, the HSS Pursuant and her patrol detect anomalous signals coming from a gas cloud on the outskirts of an unremarkable star system.  The commanding officer, directing his fleet to investigate, discovers a small Shadowyards Heavy Industries outpost in the final stages of its construction.

Unwilling to let such a flagrant symbol of disregard for Hegemony authority be constructed right in it's shadow, the patrol's commander orders his ships to attack.
