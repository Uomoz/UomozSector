Location: Agora II High Orbit
Date: 227.12.24

Shadowyards Heavy Industries has begun constructing a new manufacturing plant in orbit over Agora II.  The plant itself is extremely vulnerable during assembly and must be protected.

Unfortunately a pirate raiding group has somehow bypassed the security sweeps and is now burning for the partially constructed factory; damage to the facility now will likely render the project untenable, setting back SHI's timetable for the region by several years.  Enlisting the aid of a pair of passing mercenary ships, you and your small security detachment must prevent the pirate raiders from breaching the plant and ruining years of work.
