Location:  An insignificant system between Duranda and Corvus

Ladies and Gentlemen, at ease.

As you may have heard, Hegemony Special Forces have assaulted our research facility on Duranda III.

Intelligence suggests that Hegemony forces may have have absconded with the surviving research data and staff and are likely carrying it aboard a Mule-class frieghter, the HSS Idolotor.  We're on damage control.

The Idolotor is currently attached to a convoy that is en route to the Corvus system; the Convoy is projected to be be passing through MCX-91224-Beta near the edge of SHI's zone of control, representing our last chance to recover the missing files and scientists.  Disable the Idolotor and then fly cover 'til we can get a recovery team on site.  Unfortunately, due to the relative isolation of the area, our forces are pretty thin; you'll have to make due with what we've been able to vector for the intercept.

Any questions?  Alright, let's make 'em hurt, people.
