Location: Breh'inni 4 Listening Station
Date: 207.10.25

Having just gained significant material from a successful attack against some particularly vile Hegemony trespassers, you return to the listening station at Breh'inni 4.

Meeting up with the battleship RNS Clasp and her security detachment, you report your success to HQ.

As you disengage the comms link with the King's Hand, sensors pick up a number of incoming craft leaving hyperspace a short distance away from your position.

It seems a recently disgruntled and very wealthy Tri-Tachyon industrialist has taken great umbrage with our actions here.

This is a marvelous opportunity for more salvage.
