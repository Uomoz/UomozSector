Location: Near a backwater Hegemony world

Retreating from an unsuccessful raid into the Hegemony rear lines, a task force led by the SYS Exclamation Point has fallen afoul of a Hegemony Reservist fleet while attempting to withdraw back to safety.

With the majority of her fleet critically damaged, the commander elects to lead a rearguard action to delay the hostile force, hoping to buy time for her squadron to escape to safety.
