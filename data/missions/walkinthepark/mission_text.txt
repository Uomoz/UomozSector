Location: Breh'inni 3
Date: 207.10.13

Our simple transfer of our new gunboats has apparently hit a little bit of a snag. We've just left Breh'inni 2, on our way back to the King and a small and previously undetected Tri-Tachyon detachment seems to be nosing about.

It's clear that they've detected us. It's clear that can't happen.

Ready the munitions and silence them, but protect our new destroyers at all costs.
