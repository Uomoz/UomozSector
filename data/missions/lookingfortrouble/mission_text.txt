Location: Outskirts of the Breh'inni System
Date: 207.10.26

Valuable tech has repeatedly gone missing in the Breh'inni system, with Hegemony and Tri-Tachyon fleets alike suffering from unannounced acts of piracy.

Scouting mission after scouting mission has travelled through without detecting any signs of perpetrators.

You are commander of the HSS Marksman, leading one such Hegemony scouting fleet when your sensors pick up some unusual signals in the asteroid field near Breh'inni 6.

You detect a reconditioned Onslaught which appears to be lacking any real offensive capabilities, and several unrecognised craft. Go in and take them down.
