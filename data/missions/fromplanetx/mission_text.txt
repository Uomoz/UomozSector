In preparation for Operation Postbox, a Shadowyards expeditionary fleet is in the process for evaluating a series of starsystems for suitability for a fueling depot.  The journey has been quiet, up until their entry into the third system in planned route.

Waiting for them is a force of outdated battlewagons on an intercept course; their attempts to hail them are met with silence, and the vessels IFF transponders only return static.  Realizing that they've a fight on their hands, the expedition force commander orders all hands to battle stations.
