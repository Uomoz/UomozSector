Commodore,

Yeah. Sniffed us out. I know it wasn't your fault, or anyone's fault, really. The situation is this, however: Our prototype is about to fall into the hands of a rival corporation, and we can't send you any help from the outside. 

The TTs probably expect our Nevermore to be heavily escorted, but they don't know it's fully armed and operational. Make us proud, Commodore. I'd rather see the BRS Mercurial get blown to bits than to be slowly reverse-engineered into a rocket powered promotion for one of those smug meddlers.

- AM Out.
