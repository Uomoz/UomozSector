Our forays outside of our atmosphere have been less than satisfactory thus far, with the loss of all hands in all cases. All ships encountered within the Canis system have proven to be hostile to ourselves, and sometimes to each other.

We have restarted all the manufactories within our control, at great cost to the lifespan of the settlement, in order to raise a fleet capable of taking to the stars.

And we can't lie low and hide for much longer.

We need to take things in to our own hands.
