Location: Your supposedly 'secret' base
Date: 202.13.04

It was only a matter of time, of course, but the number you pulled on the Yardies Rock 3 facility must've been the straw that broke the camels back.

Whatever the hell a Camel is anyway; you sure as hell ain't ever seen one.

'Course, you wasn't too worried.  You knew all the back ways, and even had a secret hideout set up where them dumb 'alternative lifestyle' embracing hippies would never think to look.  And even if it was tougher than you'd thought, you managed to ditch their pursuit handily enough.

All clear right?

Except when you popped outta h-space and right into your hidey-hole, well, there weren't no hidden base anymore.  Just a lotta rubble.

And a whole hell of a lot of really pissed off Yardies.  The really nasty ones too.
