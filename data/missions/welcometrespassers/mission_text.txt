The pride of the arrogant Hegemony fleet, the HSS Spaceboy, has wandered too close to the King's Territory with a small cargo fleet. They haven't even detected our presence.

This Onslaught will provide excellent salvage, if you can surprise and outmanouevre the enemy.

Your King is watching you, Commander.
