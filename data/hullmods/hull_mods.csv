Blackrock Flux Core (Built-in),brfluxmod,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.BlackrockFlux,"Blackrock hulls are built around semi-ejectable powerplants and capacitor arrays, favoring active removal of flux instead of passive dissipation. Doubles the ship's active flux vent rate.",graphics/BR/hullmods/br_fluxcore.png
Enhanced Ejector System,ms_enjector,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.ms_enjector,"Nearly universal on shadowyards fighters, this ejection system provides additional crew protection through strategically placed buffer plates and a somewhat improved auto-ejector, increasing crew survival rates by 66%%.",graphics/hullmods/armored_weapon_emplacements.png
Biosphere,biosphere,,100,100,100,100,data.hullmods.TheNomadsBiosphere,"An onboard closed ecosystem used to grow assorted flora and fauna, and provide necessities for long-term journeys. Reduces externally-sourced supply consumption to near-zero.
