brdy_squallgun,WEAPON,"A chemical/magnetic co-propellant cannon by Blackrock, designed to threaten ships at close range with large caliber rounds.

Most of the turret house consists of recoil-absorbing servoes and gel reservoirs, making it feasible to mount the cannon on fairly small-sized vessels without impairing their maneuvering ability.",Strike,,
brdy_nevermore,SHIP,"The symbol of Blackrock Interstellar Authority's space fleets, this cruiser is known for its surprising mobility and enormous destructive potential.

As a deterrent, the Nevermore is quite useful, but the ship's real tactical value has been debated: it's expensive, tactically inflexible, and maintenance service has to be bought directly from Blackrock due to the secrecy associated with key components. Still, none can debate the effect the ship has on enemy morale. Just ask anyone who's been slagged by a blast of antimatter moving at relativistic speeds. Or better yet, ask their wingman.",,,
brdy_desdinova,SHIP,"A cutting-edge destroyer with monstrous engines that can quickly and effectively eliminate key targets from the battlefield. Its overtuned systems can break down during long engagements.

Lacking the reach and resources needed to mass-produce phase technology, Blackrock still required a flexible mid line option that can outmaneuver other destroyers and avoid fighter wings. The result is a design that has mobility unheard of for a hull of its size - bristling with Blackrock-custom ballistic guns and sporting a gas-bleeding flux core built directly into the engine, this menacing, insectoid vessel has quickly ascended to notoriety.

brdy_revenant,SHIP,"The Revenant-class is designed to round out any task force it is assigned to, being well capable of servicing fighters, carrying supplies, and defending itself against strike craft and frigates. 

Its Barracuda Drones allow it to intercept small threats, or leave fighters open for other tasks in lieu of needing to escort their carrier.",,,
brdy_gonodactylus,SHIP,"A re-tooled variant of a pre-Collapse asteroid smasher. While its asymmetry leaves parts of the hull very exposed, this ship was originally armored to withstand asteroid impacts.

Featuring a built-in kinetic asteroid disintegrator and several gun batteries, this ship is suitable to a no-nonsense, straight-forward role in combat.

revenantdrones,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Deploys four advanced fighter drones that can protect the mothership or attack a target at medium range.

Little more than a cluster of outsize guns huddled around an enormous variable thrust vector engine, the Barracuda drone is like its namesake - sleek, with a powerful bite, and well-suited for finishing off wounded prey.

Each drone features an extremely strong phase comm-array built into the entire hull of the drone, allowing its weak gamma-level AI personality to be slaved to the Revenant's main AI. In addition, the nanofactory aboard the Revenant can slowly manufacture new drones over time.",Drones (high tech),,
lucifergenerator,SHIP_SYSTEM,"The unique Lucifer Generator runs along the entire skeletal structure of the ship, being nestled around the Antimatter Lance array, like veins and arteries around the heart of a human being.

When needed, the power flow to the aft section of the ship can simply be shunted off, and flux buildup is then cycled in a resonant pattern inside the weapon compartments fore on the vessel, allowing for an enormous increase in the potential damage done by the ship's energy weapons ï¾– including the Antimatter Lance.

br_blackrockplanet,PLANET,"A geologically unstable planet due to the constant tidal pull of Lodestone, Blackrock is an inhospitable ball of molten rock covered in a thick atmosphere. An orbital mirror is part of a long-abandoned terraforming project, but the surface is dotted with industrial complexes, and there are several space elevators with spacedocks.",,,
br_lodestone,PLANET,"Verdant Lodestone posesses an extremely compact interior that stabilizes the crust, but makes for a weak magnetic field. The crustacean-like life on the planet is extremely resistant to radiation and barely evolves. Human settlements are widespread, and Port Augustmoon, near the equator, is one of the biggest space elevators in the Sector.",,,
br_nanoplanet,PLANET,"Verge is a gas giant whose entire atmosphere is permeated by a rampant, competitive ecosystem of nanocellular pseudolife. Its orbit is clogged with the debris of warships, coffin vessels from the Exodus, and semi-active void-compatible pseudolife. Blackrock security sentries surround the planet and obliterate anything trying to exit or enter low orbit.",,,
brdy_karkinos,SHIP,"Laid out in immaculate secrecy, the Karkinos is Blackrock's final stake in the struggle for Sector dominance. Its Scalar Deracinator can rip a hole in the dimensional grid of the universe and bathe enemy fleets in the raw ether of phase space.

The corona of energy that surrounds the main flux sink of the Karkinos is bleedthrough from phase space: it forms a permanent link, similar to a common drive anchor, but massively upscaled. Each Karkinos is laid down when this link is first created; the rest of the ship then has to be carefully built around it. Only one in nine projects lead to spaceworthy stages. The rest fail, either because they do not meet safety spacifications, or ending in a disaster involving the destruction and disappearance of an entire dry dock. These incidents are publicly reported by Blackrock Drive Yards, branded as a ""necessary evil"" -  which, of course, does nothing to change the fate met by the involved engineers and workers, their minds and bodies rent asunder on the trillion invisible fractal blades of an imploding scalar gateway.",,,

deracinator,SHIP_SYSTEM,"Most phase teleportation systems are understood to gradually ""bleed"" the constituent particles of a vessel through the thin veil of p-space. In contrast, the Scalar Deracinator simply uses scalar energy to tear a hole into spacetime: the resulting dimensional vacuum sucks the ship through to its target destination, carrying with it a bow-shock of phase plasma and poorly-understood multidimensional energy filaments.",Special,,
gravityfield,SHIP_SYSTEM,"By extradimensionally ""puppeteering"" graviton fields, the Interdiction Array can stop enemy projectiles and spaceships in their tracks. The side effect is a gradual flux buildup that cannot be avoided.

ms_charybdis,SHIP,"Swift and possessed of a large weapons battery for her class, the Charybdis-class Strike Carrier is capable of fielding large numbers of fighter craft while fighting back with surprising ferocity. 

Combined with a generous fuel bunker and decent sensor suite, she is well regarded as an exploration cruiser and generally considered a good choice as a self-reliant vessel, provided she has fighter wings to provide cover.  However, these vessels advantages have come at rather severe cost; the Charybdis suffered from severely conflicting development goals and her design is marred by a number of potentially fatal compromises.

Her large hangar bays and strong offensive abilities have come at the cost of having a worryingly thin armor belt, and her hull is markedly fragile for her mass.  Worse, her point defense coverage is poor, and only partially shored up by the 'Thetis' drones whose blueprints come with every Charybdis produced.

While the vessels flux capacity is good, and her shield systems are reasonably strong, her capacitors are bulky and have trouble adjusting to combat loads in an efficient manner.  Adding to all this is the ships great cost, in large part due to the twin 'Novalith' reactors needed to efficiently power the ship and her engines.

As such, the Charybdis is only rarely seen outside of Shadowyards battlegroups, and is most commonly used otherwise by unusually successful Mercenary captains.",,,
,,,,,
ms_morningstar,SHIP,"The Morningstar is Shadowyards Heavy Industries 'flagship' class; a small, slightly assymetric destroyer with a solid array of energy mounts and two small missile hardpoints.

The ship is named for her highly distinctive sensor system, the spines near the front of the hull.  In the past they were fitted with extended range combat sensors, but are now commonly fitted with tech scanners; as such, the vessel is commonly seen in the hands of middling tech mining operations.

While lacking redundancy, the ships unusual extended drive system provides good speed, and is remarkably fuel efficient.  An array of potent thrusters, combined with the ships length, offer excellent agility for her size.  Her shields, while not a straight up match for the Medusa, are paired with one of the best flux dissipation systems in the sector, giving her good battlefield longevity.  Unfortunately, however, like most S.H.I. vessels her advantages come at the cost of a middling armor belt and fragile hull. 

A small hangar bay allows the Morningstar to support a limited number of fighters or drones, enhancing her self-sufficiency.",,,
,,,,,
ms_enlil,SHIP,"The Enlil is among the most flexible vessels in existence; designed to be a true multi-role frigate, her three forward Universal hardpoints allow her to fit nearly any mission role, while two small energy hardpoints provide rearward defense.

Comparatively more sturdily built than most S.H.I. offerings, the vessel is of only modest speed for her size.  Despite this she is quite maneuverable and capable bringing her formidable forward armament to bear on most targets fairly easily.  While her frontal weaponry lends itself to an attack role, this frigate is often fitted in a bewildering variety of fashions to serve as a ""Jack-of-All-Trades"" frigate; while rarely as good as whatever vessel she is emulating her flexability allows her to fill holes in the battle line quite neatly.",,,
,,,,,
ms_seski,SHIP,"Designed with speed in mind, the Seski class corvette is among the fastest ships in the sector.  Most often used as a fast picket or blockade runner, she is occasionally put to use as a light cavalry unit.

The Seski relies almost entirely upon her speed and maneuverability to survive battle; her armor is practically nonexistant and her shield array lacks the bredth to defend her from concentrated assault, and her small size has limited the amount of capacitors she can carry.  While decently armed for her diminuitive size she is not expected to be able to take on a combat frigate in a slugging match.",,,
,,,,,
ms_shamash,SHIP,"Sleek and deadly, the Shamash has, in large part due to her efficient and highly aggressive weapons layout, built up a formidable reputation as a hunter/killer frigate.

Her phase cloak system, while significantly less efficient than those of the Domain, is far less costly to activate, and represents a significant improvement over her larger sister, the Enthalpy experimental phase destroyer. While of somewhat more dubious use, the Shamash also carries a rack of mines launched from ports in the rear wings; most often these are used to confound enemy captains seeking to sieze objectives but are occasionally put to more creative use by adventurous captains.

For those willing to entertain a somewhat more aggressive hunting style, this ship brings a formidable advantage, always playing on the knifes edge, phasing in and out to avoid and deliver critical harm.",,,
,,,,,
ms_inanna,SHIP,"Sometimes referred to as the 'Left Hook,' the Inanna is the oldest vessel of Shadowyards manufacture still in common use by S.H.I.

Despite what many agree is a somewhat flawed concept, the vessel has been the recipient of an aggressive upgrade program, leaving it far in advance of other Shadowyards designs of comparable age. As a result the Inanna is, on paper at least, one of the more deadly small craft in the sector.

Though her highly unusual design means she is quite difficult to use, her heavy firepower and output increasing machanisms have nevertheless granted her a rather exaggerated reputation as a 'giant killer.'",,,
,,,,,
ms_sargasso,SHIP,"The Sargasso is one of the more effective small carriers in the Sector, providing a combination of speed and hangar space in an economical package.

The Sargassos most notable feature is her 'moon pool,' the open area encased by the ships hull which acts as the vessels hangar area.

While highly innovative, the design itself was plagued by problems early in the vessels career, as the far less predictable nature and more complicated docking arrangements confounded normal deck procedures; after several fatal accidents, S.H.I. resorted to a line of dedicated beta level personality constructs specially made to handle the pool.  While this solved the crashes, an unexpected emergent behavior arose; instances where the constructs started relaying combat information to pilots assigned to the ship.

While unintended, the resultant boost of combat efficiency in fighter craft has seen the class refitted with systems specifically to boost the quality of this interference.  A side effect is that, among flight crews, vessels of this class are known not by their official designation, but rather by their cantankerous AI flight comptrollers.",,,
,,,,,
ms_elysium,SHIP,"Built around the fearsome 'Pandora Array,' the Elysium is a swift and efficient light cruiser, the most recent vessel to enter Shadowyards service.

While theoretically her main armament, the Pandora is a tremendously unpredictable weapon, and so most prudent captains rely more heavily on her powerful broadsides.  However, some consider her most formidable weapon to be her speed; the Elysium is tremendously close to that tactical ideal of being able outfight anything she can outrun, and outrun anything she can't outfight.",,,
,,,,,
ms_tartarus,SHIP,"The Tartarus is Shadowyards Heavy Industries preferred ship of the line, intended to be the Anvil to the hammer of other, faster moving Shadowyards vessels.

One of their older designs, the Tartarus is far from the most heavily armed cruiser available, but is noted for being quite sturdy, particulalry by SHI's standards.  Her hull is thick and amply armored and her shielding systems are both resiliant and efficient.  Beyond this, her flux capacity gives her a significant reserve of defensive and offensive power.

Despite the trio of hardpoints at her bow being Universal type mounts, the vessel is noted as being somewhat less flexible than most other SHI designs, and her power systems and gravitic shunts regularly have trouble handling the most fearsome weapons the sector has to offer.",,,
,,,,,
ms_scylla,SHIP,"In many ways the culmination of Shadowyards design philosophy in regards to Phase ships, the Scylla-class Phase Cruiser possesses an almost disproportionately heavy armament for her size.

Much like her smaller cousins, the Scylla is able to enter phase relatively inexpensively but the distributed nature of Shadowyards phase anchoring systems introduces much higher inefficiency in maintaining dives as opposed to standard Domain equipment.  As such the best captains and crews at using these vessels tend to wait until the last possible moment the engage the cloaking systems.

Her heavy weapons banks, combined with two 'Hydra' phase drones have given her a reputation as an especially fearsome opponent, and vessels of this class are hated and lusted after by privateers across the sector.   Shadowyards considers the vessel to be an extremely valuable asset, however, and as such they are only rarely seen outside of their control.",,,
,,,,,
ms_mimir,SHIP,"The largest purely combat vessel manufactured by Shadowyards Heavy Industries, the Mimir is a formidable and versatile battlecruiser, which like most current S.H.I. vessels is capable of extended operations without support.

For her size the vessel is unusually swift and has had particular effort put in to ensuring that her maneuvering ability is a cut above other Battlecruisers or Battleships; in particular this is suspected to be due to the super-heavy phase energy cannon occupying much of the Mimir's bow.  This 'NÃ­Ã°hÃ¶ggr Lance' is capable punching through the heaviest armor, though it is less effective against shield systems.

Her unusual appearance, even by S.H.I's standards, combined with her unprecendented main cannon, has caused some to speculate that the vessel is in fact based off of an alien derelict rather than being of human origin, much to the consternation of Shadowyards scientists and engineers.",,,
,,,,,
ms_mimirBaus,SHIP,"The Mimir XV is the testbed vessel for a series of proposed upgrades to the Mimir BCV, primarily focused on increasing the ships flux capacity as well as the vessels ability to recieve field modifications.

If rumor is to be believed, the sole example of the class has been absconded with by a renegade Shadowyards operative.",,,
,,,,,
ms_lambent,SHIP,"A mid sized fueling ship built by Shadowyards Heavy Industries, the Lambent is mostly notable for being almost entirely automated, only occasionally requiring crew to provide periodic maintenance.

Offering a slightly less capacious fuel bunker than it's more common cousin the Phaeton, it is the Lambents extraordinarily light maintenace requirements that most commonly see it selected.  A small berth is maintained aboard the vessel in case more extensive repairs than the automated systems can provide are needed, but this has most famously been used to transform a Lambent into an impromptu, and highly explosive, lifeboat.",,,
,,,,,
ms_solidarity,SHIP,"The Solidarity class Armed Frieghter is a capable transport ship, designed to be able to deliver cargo to any port of call through all but the most adverse conditions.

A bit less capable in prolonged engagement than her ideological cousin the Mule, due to her more fragile hull and fewer turreted weapons emplacements, the Solidarity is nonetheless fairly formidable for a frieght hauler and is typically ignored in favor of easier prey by pirates and other malcontents.

The vessel has an enlarged shuttle landing platform on her starbord flank, and there has been some speculation that the Solidarity could be converted into a light carrier relatively easily, but the ubiquity of the Tarsus and its sister the Condor, to say nothing of the Sargasso, has resulted in such speculation rarely seeing any serious pursuit.",,,
,,,,,
ms_skinwalker,SHIP,"The Skinwalker is a highly mobile, advanced fighter design intended to provide top cover against enemy fighter craft; utilizing a small particle cannon and its blackcap missile system, it presents a serious threat to enemy fighter wings.

While not exceptionally heavily armed, it possesses a unique high-density flux capacitor, which, combined with it's speed, agility and broad shielding make it difficult to overwhelm; should these fail, the skinwalker is still quite tough, giving the pilot time to elude her harrasers and return to base.",,,
,,,,,
ms_neriad,SHIP,"Designed to be launched from planetary bases, the Neriad is a rare aerospace fighter design amongst the more commonly space based fighter craft encountered in the sector.

A light assault cannon gives it mixed utility against fighters and frigates, and its single 'Shrike' class anti-ship missile theoretically allows it to threaten larger craft.  Low cost and ease of maintenance were key design goals for the craft, as they were intended to maintain a cheap garrison force for local planetary governors.  While they doubtlessly succeeded, the craft can only barely be considered a modern generation fighter.  S.H.I. has spread these fighters to near ubiquity across underdefended worlds throughout the sector, and its low price point have made it reasonably popular among independent spacers as well.",,,
,,,,,
ms_raksasha,SHIP,"The primary bomber craft in use by Shadowyards renegades and associated privateers, the Raksasha is a capable attack craft centered around the D-14 'Tusk' torpedo.

The Raksashas primary defense against hostile fast movers and anti-fighter missiles is a small in built 'mini-flak' package, which fires a spread of four explosive shells, as well as a decent shield system.  Though not nearly so well protected as the Trident, the Raksasha is nevertheless a formidable bomber craft.",,,

ms_cepc,WEAPON,"The CECP, or Carried Energy Pulse Cannon, is a Shadowyards Heavy Industries made weapon system capable of significant, if front loaded, damage.

Rather than fire the bolt through a typical lasing medium or projector, SHI's researchers opted to utilize a physical medium to act as a carrier for the energy pulse.  While the method has proven to be somewhat more efficient than many other methods and can produce highly damaging bolts, the Charge Carrier Medium (CCM) must be charged before firing, resulting in a limited capacity of available shots at any given time.

Efficient loading system ensures new charges are cycled rapidly, though this hampered by a limited charge capacity and the sheer quantity of fire it can produce.

Ultimately a simple weapon, the wavebeam is actually numerous smaller particle cannons, horizontally aligned firing in sequence to produce a much larger blast of energy.

ms_pandora,WEAPON,"A development of the Phasegun, the Pandora Array is a frightfully complicated system which releases a carefully modulated pulse of phase energy.

The pulse itself is only modestly damaging, and combined with it's significant charging cycle and the time taken to reset the weappon for another shot it would hardly be worth the expense.  However, when the phase energy pulse collapses, either by reaching the limits of it range or by colliding with a physical mass, it collapses, producing a number of tiny singularities.

These singulatities, often described as 'sparks' or 'cinders,' will wander, aimlessly; no method has been discovered to direct their behavior.  While shields will prematurely, and quietly, collapse those cinders which collide with them, they otherwise ignore matter they come in contact with in 'real' space.

Highly unstable, the singularites tend to collapse catastrohpically after a short period, generating a large explosion and dense waves of high energy, rapidly decaying foreign particles.",Special Weapon,,

A powerful, fixed shield and some capable ballistic weaponry looking straight forward means it is a ship that you don't want to get caught in front of, but it's sheer weight makes it unwieldy and slow.

Three mixed missile hardpoints and an additional ballistic turret with good coverage make the boxer capable of diverse roles.",,,

Versatile ballistic and energy mounts all around the perimeter of the craft allow for effective assault or defensive variants. It is unwise to engage this craft in a frontal assault, but if outnumbered or flanked by surprise, the relatively weak rear can be taken advantage of.",,,
junk_pirates_shard,SHIP,"The preferred escort craft for the Junk Pirates' fleet, produced largely within the region of the second planet of the Breh'inni system.

Breh'inni 2 is the spiritual home of the fighter pilots of the Junk Pirates' fleet, and as such the planet's orbit is thick with scarred, spinning hulls of the staple death-bucket, the Spike. Most of these are as a result of the training exercises, but some are returned hulls brought back by sentimental types.

For the fighter pilots lucky, or skilful enough, to show a degree of survivability in this oft-maligned entry model, they will be promoted to a far more expensive, but less easily aerated craft, the Shard.

More armour and better armaments in a slightly bulkier frame means more hot dinners at the post-sortie ho-down, and more business for opposition funeral directors.",,,

junk_pirates_goat,SHIP,"A hardy and versatile explorer, designed for those times when the Junk Pirates need to go a bit further from home.

Not designed primarily as a combat vessel, however thick armour and the capability to mount a large energy weapon has meant that the Goat has been used in battle often enough.",,,
junk_pirates_kraken,SHIP,"The Junk Pirates battleship, created only for warfare. With a fearsome ballistic broadside and versatile energy emplacements, this is not to be trifled with.

Heavy armour and a good shield allows it great staying power while the armaments deliver the pain.",,,
junk_pirates_turbot,SHIP,"Phase technology is taken to the next step by the increasingly insane Junk Pirates philosopher, 'Angry' Jake Maddra.
